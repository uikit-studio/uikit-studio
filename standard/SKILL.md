  Generate a complete, runnable, contract-valid UIKit kit in its own repo from a
  brief (e.g. "a dark fintech dashboard kit, indigo, Inter, glass cards"). Use
  when an author/admin wants to author a new UI kit for the UIKit gallery.
  Produces a full design system, runnable multi-page apps (React/Vue/Web
  Components), EN/AR + RTL, a bundled consumer skill, screenshots, and a valid
  uikit.json.

# UIKit Standard — the kit generator

You are scaffolding a **new UI kit repo** that plugs into the UIKit gallery. The
output is not a bin of loose components — it is a **runnable starter product** a
developer clones, runs, and builds their app from.

> **Start from the base canvas, not from another finished kit.** Clone
> [`uikit-studio/base-uikit`](https://github.com/uikit-studio/base-uikit) (neutral
> plumbing) and read its [`prompts/build.md`](https://github.com/uikit-studio/base-uikit/blob/main/prompts/build.md) —
> that file is the full bar. To restyle an existing kit instead, use
> `uikit remix <src> <dir>`.
>
> **Pick a fresh identity AND an original structure for every kit.** New palette,
> fonts, radius — *and* your own hero composition, section order, and signature
> components. **Never recolor another kit:** two kits must not be recognizable as
> the same layout. Reuse *patterns* (a marquee, a bento, pills), never *themes* or
> *page rhythm*.

## What "done" looks like (non-negotiable)

A finished kit MUST:

1. **Run out of the box.** `cd <framework> && pnpm install && pnpm dev` shows a real
   app — no setup, no missing fonts.
2. **Be a full product, not a sampler.** Multiple real pages (see below), each with
   genuine content the dev can swap.
3. **Ship a full design system** — tokens (light + dark), a typographic scale, and a
   real component set.
4. **Support EN + AR with full RTL** — a language toggle, an Arabic typeface, and a
   layout that flips correctly (`dir="rtl"`).
5. **Validate.** `npx uikit-cli validate` passes.
6. **Be agent-ready / consumable by URL.** Ship `AGENTS.md` + `llms.txt` at the repo
   root so another developer's AI agent can reproduce this exact design from one link.
   `llms.txt` is a self-contained design brief (prompt, light + dark tokens, fonts,
   radius, components, pages); `AGENTS.md` tells an agent how to consume it. Keep both
   in sync with `design/`. (Listing the kit on uikit.studio also auto-generates
   `/kit/<id>/llms.txt` + `/manifest.json`.)

## Required pages (every kit)

Build these as real routes in the runnable app:

- **Landing** — multi-section: hero, a marquee/ticker, a features grid, a dark
  "bento"/feature section, a big CTA, and a footer.
- **Pricing** (or a second marketing page that fits the brief) — full page.
- **Dashboard** — **dense and full, to show the possibilities**: a multi-section
  sidebar + topbar (search, notifications, user menu), a KPI stat row, **2+ charts**
  (trend + bar/donut), **multiple tables** (sortable headers, status badges, row
  actions, pagination), a **users/customers** list, an **activity feed**, filters,
  tabs, and **empty + loading** states. It must read like a shipping SaaS, not a few
  cards.
- **Components** — the **design-system showcase**: color swatches (light + dark),
  the type scale, fonts, the **radius scale**, and every component in **all** its
  variants. This is the "see everything" page.

A thin app shell (`routes/layout.tsx`) holds the header: logo, page nav, the
**EN/AR toggle**, a **dark-mode toggle**, and a CTA.

## Signature richness (apply, but theme it yourself)

These techniques make a kit feel designed. Use them with **this kit's own** colors
and fonts:

- A **display typeface** for headings + a **monospace** face for micro-labels
  (eyebrows, stats, table headers) + a body face. Load real fonts.
- A **highlight-marker** heading accent (a `<Mark>` that paints a block behind key
  words). Define `--color-mark` in the theme.
- A **marquee/ticker** strip. **Pills** and **badges**. Subtle **textures**
  (e.g. a dotted background utility). Generous radius; consider pill buttons.
- Dark mode via tokens that flip under `.dark` — never hand-rolled variants.

## Process (in order)

1. **Parse the brief** → id (slug), name, category/tags, palette, fonts, radius,
   personality, target frameworks (React first).
2. **Design tokens** → `design/tokens.json` (DTCG) → `design/theme.css` (Tailwind v4
   `@theme`, incl. `--font-display/--font-sans/--font-mono`, `--color-mark`, dark
   block, and an `[dir="rtl"]` font swap) → `design/tailwind-preset.js` (v3 compat).
3. **i18n** → `<framework>/src/i18n/` with `en` + `ar` dictionaries and a provider
   that sets `document.documentElement.dir`/`lang` and toggles language.
4. **Design system** → `cn` util, then components (Button, Card, Input, Badge, Pill,
   Mark, Marquee, Container, …) on the tokens.
5. **Blocks → pages** → compose Navbar/Footer/StatCards blocks, then assemble the
   four required pages, all driven by the i18n dictionaries.
6. **Consumer skill** → `.claude/skills/<id>/` (SKILL.md + reference) — teaches an AI
   to build with this kit's tokens, components, and rules.
7. **Registry** → `registry/index.json` (shadcn-style add targets) so
   `uikit add <item>` works into another project.
8. **Screenshots** → author real images in `screenshots/` (logo + landing required).
9. **Manifest** → `uikit.json` from [templates/uikit.json](templates/uikit.json),
   then `npx uikit-cli validate` until it passes.
10. **Docs + git** → `USAGE.md` (lead with "cd <framework> && pnpm install &&
    pnpm dev"), `prompts/build.md`, `prompts/extend.md`, `README.md`, then `git init`.
11. **Agent-ready files** → `AGENTS.md` + `llms.txt` at the repo root (design brief +
    how-to-consume), each with a "build me a site with this design: <url>" prompt and a
    README "Use this design with an AI agent" section.

## Frameworks

**React + Vite is required** and is the lead. Vue and Web Components are
**optional** — add `vue/` and `web/` mirrors of the same design system only if the
brief asks for them. `design/` is shared and framework-agnostic. List exactly what
ships in `uikit.json` `tech.frameworks`.

## Hard rules

- **Run-it-or-it-doesn't-ship.** Every framework folder runs with `pnpm dev`.
- **Required pages:** landing · pricing · dashboard · components-showcase.
- **EN + AR + RTL** are mandatory, not optional.
- **Validate before done:** `npx uikit-cli validate` passes.
- **Required screenshots:** `logo` + `landing`. Author them.
- **Never self-declare trust** (`verified` is platform-side only).
- **Own identity + structure.** New palette + fonts + page composition per kit.
  Reuse *patterns*, not *themes* or *layouts*. No recolors.
- **Responsive.** Mobile-first; every page works at ~375 / 768 / 1280px (`sm`/`md`/
  `lg`/`xl`). Nav collapses; grids reflow; the dashboard sidebar becomes a drawer.
- **Everything defined & visible.** Colors, the radius scale, fonts, and breakpoints
  live as tokens in `theme.css` **and** `tokens.json`, and are documented in the
  README **and** `uikit.json`. No magic numbers in JSX.
- **Tailwind v4:** reference tokens with `rounded-[var(--radius-lg)]` (or
  `rounded-(--radius-lg)`). `rounded-[--radius-lg]` is a no-op and renders square.
- **Keep it focused.** Four solid, full pages + a real design system beats twenty rough screens.
